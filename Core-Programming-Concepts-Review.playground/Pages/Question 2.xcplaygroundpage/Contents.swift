 # Question 2
 
 Imagine you're creating the ultimate competitor to GitHub.
 
 You want to keep track of the following metrics for each repository:
 
 - Number of commits: the total number of commits to the repository
 - Number of forks: the number of forks people have made from the repository
 - Year created: The year the repository was created
 - Month created: The month the repository was created represented by a number between 1 and 12
 - Day created: The day of the month the repository was created

 For each piece of information above, create a variable or constant (whatever is more appropriate).
 
 Then, use `print()` statements to briefly explain why you chose to use a variable or a constant for each piece of information above.

// Answer question 2 below

// Number of commits
var numberOfCommits = 1000

// Number of forks
var numberOfForks = 400

// Year
let year = 2017

// Month
let month = 4

// Day
let day = 15

// The reason of chosing variables or constants
print("for the number of commits, it's changing bepending on the time. ")
print("for the number of forks, just like the number of commits, it's changing depending on the time")
print("for the number of years, it's stable and the base of the question. It doesn't change at the time or depends on the number of other information")
print("for the number of month, just like the year, it's stable and the base of the question. It doesn't change at the time or depends on the number of other information")
print("for the number of day, just like the year and the month, it's stable and the base of the question. It doesn't change at the time or depends on the number of other information")
